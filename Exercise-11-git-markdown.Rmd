```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Downloading packages

```{r, eval=TRUE, results = "hide", echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(broom)
library(haven)
x<-read_sav("data/ESS9e03_2.sav")
```



## Having a look at the dataset
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
head(x)
```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
